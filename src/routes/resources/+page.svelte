	<h2>Volunteer Application & Criminal Records Check</h2>
	<p>
		To safeguard the safety and well-being of our students and staff, each prospective volunteer
		must complete an application through our districtwide volunteer management system called Raptor
		and then submit to an Oregon criminal records check. You'll receive a confirmation email as soon
		as the application has been approved. This process can take up to 10 business days to complete;
		we're unable to accept special requests to expedite the process, regardless of upcoming
		volunteer opportunities or events. Once approved, you can create a user profile in Raptor which
		will allow you to view and sign up for volunteer opportunities at the school or district site(s)
		that you requested. You'll also be able to communicate directly with school and district
		volunteer coordinators. Here is the link so you can sign up.
